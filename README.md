# NPF Calculator in WebAssembly

That's my first project learning the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine and playing with wasm. It's just a exposure time calculator for digital astrophotography following the [NPF rule](https://galleries.aaronpriestphoto.com/Articles/NPF-Rule-for-Sharp-Stars#:~:text=(35%20x%20aperture%20%2B%2030%20x,to%20measure%20it%20in%20microns.).
