# NPF Calculator in WebAssembly

That's my first project learning the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine and playing with wasm. It's just a exposure time calculator for digital astrophotography following the [NPF rule](https://galleries.aaronpriestphoto.com/Articles/NPF-Rule-for-Sharp-Stars).

**To run:**
```
$ docker-compose up npf_calculator
```

Then open: [http://localhost:8080/npf_calculator.html](http://localhost:8080/npf_calculator.html)
